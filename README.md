<h2>Summary</h2>
This project looks at the factors that influence life expectancy in countries worldwide. Life expectancy is a key indicator of health and well-being, shaped by socioeconomic, healthcare, and lifestyle factors. By leveraging data from the World Health Organization, this analysis identifies patterns and relationships that determine why some countries achieve longer lifespans than others.
<br />

<h2> Introduction </h2>
Life expectancy offers a unique lens to explore overall health and well-being. Inspired by personal experiences in prioritizing mental and physical health, this project asks:

- How does life expectancy vary across regions and countries?

- What factors are associated with higher or lower life expectancy?

- How have these factors and life expectancy rates changed over time?

<h2>Languages and Tools Used</h2>

- <b> üõ† Excel </b> for data cleaning.

- <b> üêç Python </b> for statistical analysis and data exploration.</b>

- <b> üìä Tableau </b>  for creating visualizations to reveal trends and insights.</b>

- <b> üìΩÔ∏è PowerPoint </b> for designing a visually engaging presentation to communicate insights effectively.</b>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

1. <b> Global Trends: </b>

     - Life expectancy has generally increased worldwide over time.

     - Specific events, like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, have caused regional declines.

2. <b> Regional Insights: </b>

     - Europe leads in life expectancy, followed by the Americas, Asia, Oceania, and Africa.

     - Sub-regions provide more nuanced insights:

         - Northern Africa outpaces Sub-Saharan Africa by almost 14 years.

         - In the Americas, Northern America surpasses Latin America and the Caribbean.

         - Australia and New Zealand significantly outlive other Oceania sub-regions.

3. <b> Key Correlations:</b>

    - <b>Positive:</b> Schooling years, income composition, and immunization rates.

    - <b>Negative:</b> High adult mortality, HIV/AIDS deaths, and drug use disorders.

    - Surprisingly, factors like BMI, alcohol consumption, and mental health disorders showed lower correlations than anticipated.</h2>

<h2>Surprising Insights</h2>

Education and resource allocation significantly impact life expectancy more than factors like obesity or healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP.


<h2> Conclusions </h2>

- Higher education levels, effective resource management, and immunization programs are strong predictors of longer life expectancy.

- Countries with lower life expectancy often face challenges in these areas, providing opportunities for targeted improvements.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

1. üîç For Researchers: Expand the analysis to include more granular data, such as urban vs. rural life expectancy disparities.

2. üèõ For Policymakers: Focus on improving education, healthcare access, and immunization programs to boost national life expectancy.

3. üå± For Individuals: While this project centers on countries, individuals can reflect on personal health factors to make informed lifestyle choices.

This project underlines the importance of systemic and individual efforts in promoting longer, healthier lives globally.
